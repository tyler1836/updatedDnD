        <h3>This is a solo project built by myself Tyler</h3>
        <p>I am a full stack web developer with a passion for video games, ttrpgs, and great storytelling. I wanted to make a fun website with some animations and some automation surrounding leveling. This has been a very large project and as a solo dev on it there may be some issues and bugs. I will leave my info down below as well as the repo url for any developers that want to fork it and make it there own. Last little bit I am hard at work on making a guide to how the website works and all the little details you can expect from using this site. Anyway I hope you enjoy</p>
